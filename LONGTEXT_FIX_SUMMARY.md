# LONGTEXT Fix Summary

## Problem
The API was throwing "Data too long for column" errors when trying to create collections and products with image data. This was happening because:

1. **Collections table**: The `images` column was defined as `TEXT` but was storing JSON arrays of image URLs
2. **Products table**: The `image` column was defined as `TEXT` but was storing large image data

## Solution Applied

### 1. Database Migrations
Created two new migrations to change the column types from `TEXT` to `LONGTEXT`:

- `1754124794300_alter_collections_table_images_column.ts`: Changes `images` column in collections table
- `1754124794400_alter_products_table_image_column.ts`: Changes `image` column in products table

### 2. Model Updates

#### Collection Model (`app/models/collection.ts`)
- Updated `images` field to handle JSON serialization/deserialization
- Changed type from `string` to `string[]`
- Added proper serialize/prepare methods for JSON handling

#### Product Model (`app/models/product.ts`)
- Updated `image` field to handle JSON serialization/deserialization
- Updated `dimensions` field to handle JSON serialization/deserialization
- Changed types to support both string and object data

### 3. Service Updates
- Updated `CollectionService` interface to use `string[]` for images
- Updated `ProductService` interface to use `string | object` for image and `object` for dimensions

### 4. Test Updates
- Updated all test files to pass arrays and objects directly instead of using `JSON.stringify()`
- Collections tests now pass `images: ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg']`
- Products tests now pass `dimensions: { width: 10, height: 20, depth: 5 }`

## Benefits
1. **No more "Data too long" errors**: LONGTEXT can handle much larger data than TEXT
2. **Better JSON handling**: Models now properly serialize/deserialize JSON data
3. **Cleaner API**: No need to manually JSON.stringify() in requests
4. **Type safety**: Better TypeScript types for the data structures

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Collection
```javascript
// Before (would fail with "Data too long" error)
{
  name: "My Collection",
  description: "A collection",
  images: JSON.stringify(['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg'])
}

// After (works correctly)
{
  name: "My Collection", 
  description: "A collection",
  images: ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg']
}
```

### Creating a Product
```javascript
// Before (would fail with "Data too long" error)
{
  title: "My Product",
  description: "A product",
  image: "large-image-data.jpg",
  dimensions: JSON.stringify({ width: 10, height: 20, depth: 5 }),
  price: 99.99,
  collectionId: 1
}

// After (works correctly)
{
  title: "My Product",
  description: "A product", 
  image: "large-image-data.jpg",
  dimensions: { width: 10, height: 20, depth: 5 },
  price: 99.99,
  collectionId: 1,
  available: true
}
```

### Product Availability Features
```javascript
// Get available products
GET /api/products/available

// Get unavailable products  
GET /api/products/unavailable

// Toggle product availability
PATCH /api/products/{id}/toggle-availability

// Create product with availability
{
  title: "My Product",
  description: "A product",
  image: "product.jpg",
  dimensions: { width: 10, height: 20, depth: 5 },
  price: 99.99,
  collectionId: 1,
  available: true  // or false
}
```

## Migration Status
All migrations have been successfully applied:
- ✅ `1754124794300_alter_collections_table_images_column` - COMPLETED
- ✅ `1754124794400_alter_products_table_image_column` - COMPLETED
- ✅ `1754124794500_alter_products_table_price_nullable` - COMPLETED
